# Creating scripts

In the root of the repository, create a `bin` directory:

```bash
mkdir bin
```

Then create some scripts, in the language of your choice, using the text editor of your choice:

```bash
vim bin/sample1
nano bin/sample2
code bin/sample3
```

And make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x bin/*
```

That's all there is to it. Now you can run them:

```bash
bin sample
```
